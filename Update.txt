US05 :

-snake_movement done


US07:

-movement_effect done

-Apple modification (getPos() added) -> finally useless cause of Apple auto-print itself

-Matrix class modification (setByTuplePosMatrix((x,y),valeur) added) -> to help the function movement effect



 
NOTE : Need use snake_movement to check the state of the game after an event and do something about that
